Soon, you can play the famous wizard card game online.

### What is done so far (newest on top):
- The messaging part of the server (initial handshake, waiting for username, exchange of messages of the format `"msg_id#msg"`.

### TODO:
- Finish the server (the network messaging part is done, it is "just" the game logic that is missing).
- Implement the client.
